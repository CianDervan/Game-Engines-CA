For my project I want to create a world that will be heavily based around cubes. I want to create a building or room out of multiple small cubes which will pulsate to the music that will be playing. While this is happening, I want for the person controlling the scene  to be able to move around and be moved through the pulsating of the cubes. As they move through the room/building I want there to be a number of statuesque objects that will each be unique and act in different ways.

Here are some videos that I have taking inspiration from.
