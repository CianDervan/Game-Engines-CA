For my project I want to create a world that will be heavily based around cubes. I want to create a building or room out of multiple small cubes which will pulsate to the music that will be playing. While this is happening, I want for the person controlling the scene  to be able to move around and be moved through the pulsating of the cubes. As they move through the room/building I want there to be a number of statuesque objects that will each be unique and act in different ways.

Here are some videos that I have taking inspiration from.

Unfortunatly my original concept that I wanted to do, I was unable to complete it. I wanted the cube that incases the circle to be much bigger and have more objects that pulsed to the music along with the cubes that made up the exterior. The exterior had to be reduced as the ammount of cubes that I originally wanted was to much for my laptop to handle. In terms of getting the exterrior to pulse it tried a few ways both judt trying it on my own and using the internet to find other ways to do it. Unfortunatly every way either failed or crashed my laptop so im uncertain if this would have worked and my laptop couldnt handle it or if it was also a failure 


DESCRIPTION OF WHAT I DID
I started off by creating the large exterior of of cubes. I did this by using and manipulating code that we used at the begging of the semester.
After this I started to get the cubes that made up the exterior to pulse unfortunatly I was unable to get this to work and gave up on it so that I didnt loose to much time on it and began to focus on other elements of the project.
Next I created the ring that is inside the structre made by cubes. I did this through code. Youtube tutorials really helped me as i got an idea of what was doable with the time and my skill level. 

WHAT IM MOST PROUD OF
What I'm most proud of is everything. I created something that I think is really cool and colorful through code. At the start I wasnt sure what i would be capeable of doing as im not a strong coder and Im really happy with what I got to make.
