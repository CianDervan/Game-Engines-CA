For my project I want to create a world that will be heavily based around cubes. I want to create a building or room out of multiple small cubes which will pulsate to the music that will be playing. While this is happening, I want for the person controlling the scene  to be able to move around and be moved through the pulsating of the cubes. As they move through the room/building I want there to be a number of statuesque objects that will each be unique and act in different ways.

Here are some videos that I have taking inspiration from.

Unfortunatly my original concept that I wanted to do, I was unable to complete it. I wanted the cube that incases the circle to be much bigger and have more objects that pulsed to the music along with the cubes that made up the exterior. The exterior had to be reduced as the ammount of cubes that I originally wanted was to much for my laptop to handle. In terms of getting the exterrior to pulse it tried a few ways both judt trying it on my own and using the internet to find other ways to do it. Unfortunatly every way either failed or crashed my laptop so im uncertain if this would have worked and my laptop couldnt handle it or if it was also a failure
